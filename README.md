Todoey
An app that allows the user to create To-Do lists full of customizable items organized by customizable categories.

Features: This app has multiple views and is organized using MVC. The view was designed using Autolayout and UIKit. I used Cocoapods to install the RealmSwift, Chameleon, and SwipeCellKit frameworks. The views display categories and items via TableViews. The Categories and Items in each category are defined using Core Data, and persisted in a SQLite database. There is some Objective-C written to complete the context fetch requests on the data persisted via Core Data. There are also commits that use other methods such as Realm to persist this data.
